If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else. 
Booker T. Washington


If you keep on doing what you've always done, you will keep getting what you've always gotten

You can come out bitter or you can come out better. Donâ€™t just go through it, grow through it. There is purpose in your pain.

If we did the things we are capable of we would astound ourselves
Edison
